## Project Deliverables

Your entire project will be submitted as a **single GitHub repository**. This repository must contain everything needed to understand, run, and evaluate your work, including the link to your video presentation.

### Part 1: Your GitHub Repository

Your repository must be well-organized and contain the following:

* **Source Code:** All source code (e.g., .py, .java, .c, etc.), preferably in a `src/` or `app/` folder. Code must be clean and well-commented.
* **README.md File:** The project homepage, which must include:
  * The link to your video presentation at the very top.
  * A clear description of the project's purpose.
  * A list of all dependencies and libraries required.
  * Step-by-step instructions for setup and execution.
  * A usage guide with examples.
* **.gitignore File:** A file specifying which files and directories Git should ignore.



### Part 2: Final Writeup

A **5-7 page report** in PDF format must be included in the repository, preferably in a `docs/` or `report/` folder. The report must contain:

1. Introduction & Purpose ("The What") 
2. Technical Implementation ("The How") 
3. Justification & Analysis ("The Why") 
4. Conclusion 

### Part 3: Video Presentation

Record a **10 to 15-minute** professional walkthrough video. It must include:

* A brief introduction to the problem.
* A **live demonstration** of your tool in action.
* A brief walkthrough of important code and architecture.
* A summary of results and conclusions.
* **Hosting:** Use a platform like YouTube (set to "Unlisted") or Vimeo.

## Recommended GitHub Repository Structure

A well-organized repository is a key part of a professional project.

| File/Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `your-project-name/` | Root directory |
| `├── .gitignore` | Ignores files like virtual environments, compiled code, etc. |
| `├── README.md` | Your project's main documentation and user guide. |
| `├── requirements.txt` | Lists all dependencies (or package.json, pom.xml, etc.). |
| `├── src/` | For all your source code. |
| `└── docs/` | For all supporting documentation. |
| `    └── Final_Writeup_LastName.pdf` | Your final report. |

Note: You may include other folders like `data/` or `tests/` as needed.
